Subject: Urgent: Data Discrepancy in Sales report
Dear Dharmesh,

I have noticed a discrepancy in Sales dataset, where the sales figures do not match ERP system. This may impact reporting accuracy.
I have cross-checked the data and tried resolving it but need your guidance to proceed. Please advise on the next steps or let me know a good time to discuss.

Thank You
