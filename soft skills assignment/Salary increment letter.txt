2) Asking for raise salary -

Subject: Request for Salary Increment

Dear manager,
I hope you are doing well. I would like to formally request a salary increment based on my contributions as a Data Analyst at Tops Technology.
 My current salary is â‚¹3.5 lakh per annum, and I would like to request a 50% increment. Through my cost-identifying analysis, our company has 
successfully reduced 80% of total expenses, contributing significantly to overall efficiency and profitability. Given my impact on cost savings
 and business growth, I would appreciate a review of my compensation. I look forward to discussing this further at your convenience.

Best regards,
Anand Malviya
